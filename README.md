# CancerSTFormer

CancerSTFormer consists of a pair of spatially aware transcriptomic foundation models to accommodate niche modeling at different length scales. These models, at the 50um-Local and 250um-Extended scales, possess unique capabilities to recover ligand-target gene relationships, niche-specific differentially expressed genes, and organ-specific metastasis associated genes in diverse cancer applications. CancerSTFormer can also reveal the responses of immune-checkpoint blockade therapies, and other targeted therapies, on patients’ tumors given their ST profiles through gene perturbation analysis.
